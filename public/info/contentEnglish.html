    <h2>A guide for tourists who wants a kosher stay in Norway</h2>
    <p class="info_modal__body__p">
        The products that appear in this list are available in most convenience stores and
        supermarkets.
        Most of these products are not marked as kosher. You are dependent on the list to be
        able to
        identify the kosher-approved products.
    </p>
    <p class="info_modal__body__p">
        Kosher meat, cheese and other special products are available in the kosher-shop in The
        Jewish
        Community, Bergstien 13, Oslo. However, the kosher-shop has limited opening hours.
        Presently
        the shop is open Wednesdays from 15.00 to 19.00. During summer and other vacation
        seasons,
        opening hours can be further limited.
    </p>
    <p class="info_modal__body__p">
        If you cook your own food, there are many ways to live kosher. You can buy kosher fish
        in virtually
        all supermarkets. Disposable grills are widely available, though you should always
        check if it
        permitted to use grills in parks or in other public areas. If you hire a cabin, there
        will very often be
        a small kitchen in the cabin. Such a kitchen is obviously not kosher. Still, if you
        bring your own
        pot or frying pan, such equipment can be used on the Stovetop. Disposable plates and
        cutlery are
        available in all supermarkets.
    </p>
    <p class="info_modal__body__p">
        What can you eat at the breakfast buffet that most hotels in Norway serve? All
        not-mixed fruit
        juices i.e. pressed fresh fruits (for example orange-juice or apple-juice) are kosher.
        Coffee and tea
        are kosher. Swedish crackers (“knekkebrød”) from WASA are kosher and you find them in
        the
        breakfast buffet in most Norwegian hotels. Cereals form Kellogg’s are also kosher.
        Milk, butter,
        honey and smoked salmon are all kosher. All fresh vegetables besides onion can also be
        eaten. The
        hotels plates and cutlery can only be used for cold food. Boiled eggs can only be eaten
        if they are
        cooked in a steamer in a pot that is exclusively used for this purpose. Most Norwegian
        hotels boil
        eggs this way.
